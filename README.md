# secure-redirect
A simple redirect service, designed to (to the extent given) securely remove the website a user was visiting.

I designed this after noticing a lot of websites relating to LGBTQ+ topics, did have a quick exit button, but it could still allow someone to simply press the back button. This service eliminates that worry, but also gives the option to keep the back button if so wished.
